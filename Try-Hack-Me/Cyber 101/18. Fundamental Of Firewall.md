## 1. Introduction to Firewalls

### What is a Firewall?
- **Analogous to security guards** for digital devices
- **Purpose**: Inspects incoming/outgoing network traffic
- **Function**: Acts as a barrier between internal systems and external networks
- **Core principle**: Allow or deny traffic based on predefined rules

### Key Characteristics
- Monitors data flow between devices and internet
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Can filter beyond basic rules with advanced functionalities
- First line of defense for network security

## 2. Types of Firewalls

### Classification by OSI Layers & Capabilities

#### üîπ Stateless Firewall
- **OSI Layers**: 3 & 4 (Network & Transport)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Basic packet filtering
  - No memory of previous connections
  - Fast processing
  - Treats each packet independently
- **Limitation**: Cannot apply complex policies based on connection history

#### üîπ Stateful Firewall
- **OSI Layers**: 3 & 4
- **Characteristics**:
  - Tracks connection states in state table
  - Remembers previous connections
  - Allows subsequent packets from approved connections
  - More secure than stateless
- **Advantage**: Context-aware filtering

#### üîπ Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Gateway)
- **OSI Layer**: 7 (Application)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Acts as intermediary
  - Inspects packet content
  - Masks internal IP addresses
  - Provides content filtering
  - Offers application control

#### üîπ Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
- **OSI Layers**: 3-7
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Deep packet inspection
  - Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
  - Heuristic analysis
  - SSL/TLS decryption
  - Threat intelligence correlation
  - Real-time malicious activity blocking

### Firewall Comparison Table

| Firewall Type | Key Characteristics | Use Cases |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Stateless** | Basic filtering, No connection tracking, High speed | High-speed networks, Basic filtering needs |
| **Stateful** | Connection tracking, Complex rules, Pattern recognition | Networks requiring connection awareness |
| **Proxy** | Content inspection, Application control, Anonymity | Content filtering, Application security |
| **NGFW** | Advanced threat protection, IPS, Heuristic analysis | Enterprise networks, Advanced security needs |

## 3. Firewall Rules & Components

### Basic Rule Components
- **Source Address**: Origin IP of traffic
- **Destination Address**: Target IP receiving data
- **Port**: Communication port number
- **Protocol**: Communication protocol (TCP/UDP)
- **Action**: Allow/Deny/Forward
- **Direction**: Inbound/Outbound traffic

### Action Types

#### ‚úÖ Allow Action
- Permits specified traffic
- **Example Rule**:
  | Action | Source | Destination | Protocol | Port | Direction |
  |--------|---------|-------------|----------|------|-----------|
  | Allow | 192.168.1.0/24 | Any | TCP | 80 | Outbound |

#### ‚ùå Deny Action
- Blocks specified traffic
- **Example Rule**:
  | Action | Source | Destination | Protocol | Port | Direction |
  |--------|---------|-------------|----------|------|-----------|
  | Deny | Any | 192.168.1.0/24 | TCP | 22 | Inbound |

#### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Forward Action
- Redirects traffic to different segments
- **Example Rule**:
  | Action | Source | Destination | Protocol | Port | Direction |
  |--------|---------|-------------|----------|------|-----------|
  | Forward | Any | 192.168.1.8 | TCP | 80 | Inbound |

### Rule Directionality

#### üì• Inbound Rules
- Apply to incoming traffic
- **Example**: Allow HTTP traffic (port 80) on web server

#### üì§ Outbound Rules
- Apply to outgoing traffic
- **Example**: Block SMTP traffic (port 25) except from mail server

#### üîÄ Forward Rules
- Redirect internal traffic
- **Example**: Forward HTTP traffic to web server

## 4. Windows Defender Firewall

### Overview
- Built-in Microsoft firewall
- Basic to advanced rule creation
- Access via: Search ‚Üí "Windows Defender Firewall"

### Network Profiles
- **Private Networks**: Home/work networks
- **Public Networks**: Untrusted networks (coffee shops, etc.)
- **Network Location Awareness (NLA)**: Auto-detects network type

### Management Options
1. **Allow Apps**: Permit specific applications through firewall
2. **Turn On/Off**: Enable/disable firewall (not recommended to disable)
3. **Restore Defaults**: Reset to original settings

### Custom Rule Creation Example
**Objective**: Block outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80, 443)

#### Steps:
1. **Advanced Settings** ‚Üí **Outbound Rules** ‚Üí **New Rule**
2. **Rule Type**: Custom ‚Üí All programs
3. **Protocol**: TCP, Remote ports: 80,443 (comma-separated, no spaces)
4. **Action**: Block the connection
5. **Profile**: Apply to all network types
6. **Name**: "Block HTTP/HTTPS Outbound"

#### Verification:
- Before rule: Can access websites
- After rule: Connection errors when browsing

## 5. Linux Firewalls

### Core Framework: Netfilter
- Foundation for Linux firewall utilities
- Provides packet filtering, NAT, connection tracking

### Available Utilities

#### üîß iptables
- Widely used traditional utility
- Complex syntax but powerful

#### üîß nftables
- Successor to iptables
- Enhanced packet filtering capabilities

#### üîß firewalld
- Predefined rule sets
- Network zone configurations

#### üîß ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- User-friendly interface
- Simplifies iptables configuration

### ufw Command Reference

```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Disable firewall
sudo ufw disable

# Allow all outgoing traffic
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Deny incoming SSH traffic
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp

# List all rules with numbers
sudo ufw status numbered

# Delete rule by number
sudo ufw delete [rule_number]
```

### ufw Rule Management
- **Default Policies**: Set baseline allow/deny rules
- **Port-based Rules**: Specify port/protocol combinations
- **IPv6 Support**: Automatic IPv6 rule creation
- **Numbered Listing**: Easy rule identification and deletion
