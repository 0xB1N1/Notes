# üóÑÔ∏è Database 101

A **Database** is a collection of organized, structured information such as usernames, passwords, posts, etc.  

There are two main types:

- **Relational DB (SQL)**  
- **Non-Relational DB (NoSQL)**  

---

## üìä Relational Database (RDB)

- Data is stored in **tables** (rows + columns).  
- Example: User entry ‚Üí first_name, last_name, email, username, password.  
- Supports **relationships** between tables.  
- Best when data requires **accuracy, consistency, and fixed schema**.  

---

## üìÇ Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)

- Data stored in **non-tabular formats** (documents, key-value, graphs).  
- Flexible schema ‚Üí good for data with varying formats.  
- Used in **social media, logs, real-time apps**.  

**Example (MongoDB document):**

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("4556712cd2b2397ce1b47661"),
  "name": { "first": "Thomas", "last": "Anderson" },
  "date_of_birth": "1964-09-02",
  "occupation": ["The One"],
  "steps_taken": 4738947387743977493
}
````

---

## üìë Tables, Rows, and Columns

- Data is stored in **Tables**.
    
- Each row = record, each column = attribute.
    

**Example Table:**

|id|Name|Publish_Date|
|---|---|---|
|1|Book A|1969-01-12|
|2|Book B|1869-02-25|

- **Columns** ‚Üí must have defined **data types** (String, Integer, Float, Date).
    
- If datatype mismatch ‚Üí record rejected.
    

---

## üîë Keys (Primary & Foreign)

- **Primary Key** ‚Üí Unique identifier for each row.
    
- **Foreign Key** ‚Üí A column linking two tables.
    

**Example:**

- `Books` table has `author_id`.
    
- `Authors` table has `id`.
    
- `author_id` (FK) in Books references `id` (PK) in Authors.
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è DBMS & SQL

- **DBMS** (Database Management System) ‚Üí Software to manage DB.
    
- Examples: MySQL, MongoDB, OracleDB, MariaDB.
    
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) ‚Üí Language to query and manipulate RDBs.

## üíª MySQL Practical

### üîπ Login

```bash
mysql -u username -p
```

### üîπ Database Statements

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_name;
SHOW DATABASES;
USE db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
```

### üîπ Table Statements

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_inventory (
  book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  book_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  publication_date DATE
);
```

- **AUTO_INCREMENT** ‚Üí Auto increase ID.
    
- **PRIMARY KEY** ‚Üí Unique identifier.
    
- **VARCHAR(255)** ‚Üí String up to 255 chars.
    
- **NOT NULL** ‚Üí Value required.
    
- **DATE** ‚Üí Date type.
    

Other operations:

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
DESCRIBE book_inventory;
ALTER TABLE book_inventory ADD page_count INT NOT NULL;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

---

## üîÑ CRUD Operations

- **Create** ‚Üí `INSERT`
    

```sql
INSERT INTO books (id, name, published_date, description)
VALUES (1, "Android Security Internals", "2014-10-14", "In-depth guide to Android Security.");
```

- **Read** ‚Üí `SELECT`
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books;
SELECT name, description FROM books;
```

- **Update** ‚Üí `UPDATE`
    

```sql
UPDATE books
SET description = "Updated Security Guide"
WHERE id = 1;
```

- **Delete** ‚Üí `DELETE`
    

```sql
DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## üìú SQL Clauses

- **DISTINCT** ‚Üí Removes duplicates
    

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM books;
```

- **GROUP BY** ‚Üí Groups rows
    

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY name;
```

- **ORDER BY** ‚Üí Sort results
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY published_date ASC;
```

- **HAVING** ‚Üí Filter groups
    

```sql
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM books
GROUP BY name
HAVING name LIKE '%Hack%';
```

---

## üîé Operations

### Logical Operators

- **LIKE**
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE description LIKE "%guide%";
```

- **AND**
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE category="Tech" AND name="SQL";
```

- **OR**
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE name LIKE "%Hack%" OR name LIKE "%Guide%";
```

- **NOT**
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE NOT name LIKE "%Hack%";
```

- **BETWEEN**
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
```

---

### Comparison Operators

|Operator|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`=`|Equal to|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = 1;`|
|`!=` or `<>`|Not equal to|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id != 1;`|
|`>`|Greater than|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id > 5;`|
|`<`|Less than|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id < 10;`|
|`>=`|Greater or equal|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id >= 3;`|
|`<=`|Less or equal|`SELECT * FROM books WHERE id <= 7;`|

## ‚ö° SQL Functions

### String Functions

- **CONCAT**
    

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(name, " is written by ", author) AS book_info FROM books;
```

- **SUBSTRING**
    

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 5) AS short_name FROM books;
```

- **LENGTH**
    

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM books;
```

---

### Aggregate Functions

- **COUNT**
    

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM books;
```

- **SUM**
    

```sql
SELECT SUM(page_count) AS total_pages FROM books;
```

- **MAX**
    

```sql
SELECT MAX(publication_date) AS latest_book FROM books;
```

- **MIN**
    

```sql
SELECT MIN(publication_date) AS oldest_book FROM books;
```

- **AVG**
    

```sql
SELECT AVG(page_count) AS avg_pages FROM books;
```
