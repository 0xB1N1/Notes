# SOC (Security Operations Center) - Comprehensive Notes

## 1. Introduction to SOC

### The Modern Security Challenge
- **Digital Transformation**: Critical data ("secrets") now stored digitally rather than physical files
- **Threat Landscape**: Constant discovery of new vulnerabilities by threat actors
- **Traditional Security Limitations**: Conventional practices insufficient against modern threats
- **Solution**: Dedicated security teams managing organizational security 24/7

### SOC Definition
> **SOC (Security Operations Center)**: A dedicated facility operated by specialized security teams that continuously monitors an organization's network and resources to identify and prevent suspicious activity.

**Key Characteristics:**
- 24/7/365 operation
- Centralized monitoring and response
- Proactive threat identification
- Damage prevention focus

## 2. SOC Core Functions: Detection & Response

### Detection Capabilities

#### 1. Vulnerability Detection
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness that attackers can exploit to exceed authorized permissions
- **Examples**: Unpatched software, misconfigured systems
- **SOC Role**: Identify systems requiring patches/updates

**Practical Example:**
```
Scenario: Microsoft releases patch for critical Windows vulnerability (CVE-2024-XXXX)
SOC Action: Scan network for unpatched Windows systems and prioritize remediation
```

#### 2. Unauthorized Activity Detection
- **Focus**: Identify compromised credentials and unauthorized access
- **Indicators**: Geographic anomalies, unusual access patterns

**Practical Example:**
```
Alert: Login from unusual location (User normally logs in from New York, now from Russia)
SOC Action: Immediately investigate and potentially block the session
```

#### 3. Policy Violation Detection
- **Security Policy**: Organization-specific rules for security and compliance
- **Examples**: Pirated software download, insecure data transmission

**Practical Example:**
```
Detection: Employee downloading torrented software on company network
SOC Action: Block download, notify employee, enforce policy compliance
```

#### 4. Intrusion Detection
- **Scenarios**: Web application exploitation, malware infections
- **Methods**: Behavioral analysis, threat intelligence

**Practical Example:**
```
Incident: Employee visits compromised website, downloads malware
SOC Action: Isolate infected system, analyze malware, prevent spread
```

### Response Capabilities

#### Incident Response Support
- **Minimization**: Reduce impact of security incidents
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify how incident occurred
- **Recovery**: Restore normal operations securely

**Incident Response Flow:**
1. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Eradication**: Remove threat components
3. **Recovery**: Restore systems safely
4. **Lessons Learned**: Improve future defenses

## 3. The Three Pillars of SOC

### Interdependent Framework
```
People + Process + Technology = Mature SOC Environment
```

| Pillar | Role | Importance |
|--------|------|------------|
| **People** | Security professionals operating tools | Human analysis and decision-making |
| **Process** | Standardized procedures and workflows | Consistent, efficient operations |
| **Technology** | Security tools and solutions | Automation and scalability |

### Analogy: Fire Department
```
False Alarm Scenario:
- Multiple fire alarms trigger simultaneously
- Most caused by cooking smoke, not real fires
- Without human judgment, resources wasted on false positives

SOC Parallel:
- Security tools generate numerous alerts
- Human analysts distinguish real threats from noise
- Prevents alert fatigue and resource misallocation
```

## 5. Processes: SOC Operational Workflows

### Alert Triage Process

#### The 5 Ws Framework

**Example Alert:** `Malware detected on Host: GEORGE PC`

| Question | Investigation & Answer |
|----------|------------------------|
| **What?** | Malicious file detected, type: Trojan, specific behavior: keylogging |
| **When?** | Detection time: 13:20, June 5, 2024; First appearance: 13:15 same day |
| **Where?** | Host: GEORGE-PC-001, Directory: C:\Users\George\Downloads\ |
| **Who?** | User: George Smith (Marketing Department), Logged-in session active |
| **Why?** | Downloaded "free" software from pirated website, bypassed security warnings |

#### Severity Classification Matrix

| Level | Criteria | Response Time |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Active compromise, data exfiltration | Immediate (<15 minutes) |
| **High** | Malware infection, unauthorized access | Rapid (<1 hour) |
| **Medium** | Policy violations, suspicious activity | Standard (<4 hours) |
| **Low** | Informational, false positives | Scheduled (<24 hours) |

### Reporting Process

#### Escalation Workflow
```
Tier 1 Analyst → Creates ticket with initial findings → Escalates to Tier 2
Tier 2 Analyst → Deep investigation → Updates ticket with evidence
Tier 3 Analyst → Incident response initiation → Management notification
```

#### Ticket Documentation Requirements
