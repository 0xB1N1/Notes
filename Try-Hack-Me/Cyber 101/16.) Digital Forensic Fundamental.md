    A[Collection] --> B[Examination]
    B --> C[Analysis]
    C --> D[Reporting]
```

### Phase 1: Collection

**Objective**: Secure and preserve original evidence without tampering

**Key Activities:**
- Identify all potential evidence sources (computers, mobile devices, storage media)
- Document device details and physical condition
- Maintain evidence integrity through proper handling

**Challenges:**
- Large volumes of potential evidence
- Risk of evidence alteration during collection
- Legal requirements for evidence handling

### Phase 2: Examination

**Objective**: Filter and extract relevant data from collected evidence

**Practical Examples:**
```
Scenario: Digital camera with 10,000 photos
Requirement: Only need photos from specific date range
Action: Filter by timestamp, extract relevant subset

Scenario: Multi-user computer system
Requirement: Investigate specific user account
Action: Isolate user profile, extract user-specific data
```

**Examination Techniques:**
- Data filtering based on timeframes, file types, keywords
- Deleted file recovery
- Metadata extraction
- Hash analysis for file identification

### Phase 3: Analysis

**Objective**: Correlate evidence to reconstruct events and draw conclusions

**Analysis Methods:**
- **Timeline Analysis**: Chronological reconstruction of events
- **Data Correlation**: Connecting evidence from multiple sources
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Understanding user/attacker patterns
- **Impact Assessment**: Determining scope and consequences

**Case Example Analysis:**
```
Evidence: Bank map + Security bypass plans + Communication records
Correlation: Shows coordinated planning among multiple parties
Conclusion: Organized criminal activity with specific targets
```

### Phase 4: Reporting

**Objective**: Document findings for legal and management audiences

**Report Components:**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for non-technical readers
- **Methodology**: Detailed explanation of investigation process
- **Findings**: Specific evidence discovered and its significance
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for prevention and improvement

**Audience Considerations:**
- **Law Enforcement**: Focus on legal admissibility and chain of evidence
- **Executive Management**: Business impact and risk mitigation
- **Technical Teams**: Detailed technical findings and remediation steps

## 4. Evidence Acquisition Procedures

### Legal and Procedural Requirements

#### Proper Authorization
**Importance**: Evidence collected without authorization may be inadmissible in court

**Authorization Documentation:**
- Search warrants
- Court orders
- Organizational consent forms
- Legal compliance verification

**Considerations:**
- Scope of authorization (what can be searched)
- Jurisdictional boundaries
- Privacy law compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

#### Chain of Custody

**Definition**: Formal documentation tracking evidence handling from collection to presentation

**Chain of Custody Document Elements:**
```
Evidence Description:
- Item name and type
- Serial numbers, unique identifiers
- Physical condition notes

Collection Details:
- Collector names and credentials
- Date, time, location of collection
- Collection method used

Storage and Access:
- Storage location records
- Access logs (who, when, why)
- Transportation records

Integrity Verification:
- Hash values for digital evidence
- Tamper-evident sealing records
- Continuity verification
```

**Practical Example:**
```
Case: USB drive evidence
Chain of Custody:
1. Collected by Officer Smith, 2024-06-05 14:30
2. Sealed in evidence bag #457
3. Stored in evidence locker #3
4. Accessed by Analyst Jones, 2024-06-06 09:15 for analysis
5. Hash verified before and after analysis (match confirmed)
```

#### Write Blockers

**Purpose**: Prevent alteration of original evidence during acquisition

**Types of Write Blockers:**
- **Hardware Write Blockers**: Physical devices between evidence and analysis system
- **Software Write Blockers**: Applications that intercept write commands

**Why Use Write Blockers:**
- Preserve original file timestamps
- Prevent accidental modification
- Maintain evidence integrity for court
- Block automated system writes (updates, temporary files)

**Implementation Example:**
```
Scenario: Acquiring evidence from suspect's hard drive
Without Write Blocker:
- System updates might modify access times
- Temporary files could overwrite deleted data
- File system journaling might alter metadata

With Write Blocker:
- Original drive remains completely unchanged
- All timestamps and metadata preserved
- Evidence integrity maintained for legal proceedings
```

## 5. Windows Forensics

### Evidence Acquisition Strategy

#### Two Critical Image Types

##### 1. Disk Imaging (Non-Volatile Evidence)
**What**: Complete bit-by-bit copy of storage media
**Preservation**: Survives system restart/shutdown
**Evidence Includes**: Files, documents, browsing history, system logs

##### 2. Memory Imaging (Volatile Evidence)
**What**: Copy of RAM contents at time of acquisition
**Criticality**: Must be captured first (lost on power loss)
**Evidence Includes**: Running processes, open files, network connections, encryption keys

### Acquisition Priority Protocol
```
1. Memory Image (immediately - before any system interaction)
2. Disk Image (after memory capture)
3. Network connections (if applicable)
4. External device analysis
```
