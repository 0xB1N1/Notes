- List the **parts of an atom**.
    
- Define the **valence shell** of an atom.
    
- Identify the **unit for measuring current**.
    
- Draw the **symbol for current** in a circuit.
    
- Explain the **difference between conductors, insulators, and semiconductors**.
    
- Define the difference between **potential, electromotive force (emf), and voltage**.
    
- Draw the **symbol for voltage**.
    
- Identify the **unit for measuring voltage**.

## 1. Matter

- Anything that **occupies space** and has **mass/weight** is called **matter**.
    
- The absence of matter is called **space**.
    

---

## 2. Element

- The **basic building block of nature**; it cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means.
    
- Modern periodic table has **118 known elements**.
    
    - **94** occur naturally.
        
    - **24** are synthetic (from _Americium → Oganesson_).
        
- Elements are distinguished by the **number of protons and neutrons** in their atoms.

## 3. Inside an Atom

- **Nucleus** → Central core containing protons & neutrons.
    
- **Proton** → Positively charged particle inside the nucleus.
    
- **Neutron** → Neutral (uncharged) particle inside the nucleus.
    
- **Electron** → Negatively charged particle orbiting the nucleus.
    

🔹 **Atomic Number** → Number of protons in the nucleus.  
🔹 **Atomic Mass** → Total number of protons + neutrons.  
🔹 **Shells** → Paths of electrons around nucleus (K, L, M, N, O, P, Q).  
🔹 **Valence Shell** → Outermost shell.  
🔹 **Valence** → Number of electrons in the valence shell.

## 4. Conductors

- Materials with **many free electrons** (usually ≤ 3 electrons in valence shell).
    
- Allow easy flow of electric current.
    
- **Examples (highest to lower conductivity):**  
    **Silver → Copper → Gold → Aluminum → Tungsten → Iron → Nichrome**
    

---

## 5. Insulators

- Materials that **resist the flow of electrons/ions**.
    
- Electrons are tightly bound in the valence shell (usually ≥ 5 electrons).
    
- **Examples (strongest to weaker):**  
    **Mica → Glass → Teflon → Paper → Rubber → Bakelite → Oils → Porcelain → Air**
    

---

## 6. Semiconductors

- Materials that behave **between conductors and insulators**.
    
- **Intrinsic (pure):** Germanium (Ge), Carbon (C), Silicon (Si).
    
- Conductivity depends on **temperature**.
    
- **Extrinsic (doped):** Impurities added to control conductivity.
    
    - **n-type** (extra electrons)
        
    - **p-type** (holes/positive carriers).
        

---

## 7. Superconductors

- Materials that exhibit **zero resistance** when cooled below a critical temperature.
    
- Electrons flow without collision → no energy loss.
    
- Expel magnetic fields (Meissner effect) → enable **magnetic levitation**.
    
- Example: **Special ceramics**.
    

---

## 8. Ions

- **Negative Ion (Anion):** Atom that gains electrons.
    
- **Positive Ion (Cation):** Atom that loses electrons.
    
- **Ionization:** Process of gaining or losing electrons.

## 9. Current

- Flow of electrons from **negative terminal → positive terminal**.
    
- Represented by: **I**
    

---

## 10. Coulomb

- 1 Coulomb = **6.24 × 10¹⁸ electrons**.
    
- Represented by: **C**
    

---

## 11. Ampere

- 1 Ampere = **1 Coulomb of charge passing a point per second**.
    
- Unit of current: **Ampere (A)**.
    

---

## 12. Potential

- The **ability of a source** to perform electrical work.
    
- Difference in potential creates movement of electrons (emf / voltage).
    

---

## 13. Voltage

- The **driving force** that moves electrons through a circuit.
    
- Similar to **pressure in water pipes**.
    
- Represented by: **E**.
    
- Unit: **Volt (V)**.
    

---

## 14. Resistance

- The **opposition to the flow of electrons**.
    
- Depends on **size, shape, and temperature** of material.
    
- Unit: **Ohm (Ω)**.
