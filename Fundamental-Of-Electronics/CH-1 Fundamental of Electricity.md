# Objective

*  After Completing this chapter, I Know 
	* Define Matter, element, molecule.
	* List the parts of an atoms
	* Define the valence shell of an atom
	* Identify the unit for measuring current
	* Draw the symbol used to present current in a circuit
	* Describe the difference between conductors and insulators and semiconductors
	* Define difference between potential, electromotive force and voltage.
	* Draw the symbol used to represent voltage
	* Identify the unit used to measure voltage


## Matter

* Any thing that occupies space and has weight is called matter.
* The absence of matter is space

## Element 

* It is the basic building block of nature and it cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means.
* There are 118 known elements in the modern periodic table. There are 94 elements which are found naturally and 24 are synthesized in the laboratories (from americium to oganesson).
* Elements are distinguish by the presence of no of proton and neutron in there atom.

## Inside A Atom

* **Nucleus** :- Located in the center of the atom, which has other subatomic particles.
* **Proton** :- Positively Charged particles inside nucleus.
* **Neutron** :- Uncharged particles inside nucleus.
* **Electron** :- Negative Charged particles that orbit around nucleus

* **Atomic Number** :- There number of proton in nucleus of the atoms
* **Atomic Weight** :- The mass of the atom, Determined by the total no proton and neutron in the nucleus.
* **Shell** :- Electrons orbital path, Its a concentric circles around nucleus filled in the sequence
* **Valence Shell** :- The outermost shell of the atom, [K,L,M,N,O,P,Q]
* Valence :- The no. of electron contained in the valence shell

## Conductors

* Materials that contain large amount of free electrons or The materials that have 3 or fewer electrons in there valance shell, its a good conductors.
* The conductivity of a material is defined by that how easily a element allow the flow of electrical charge (electrons/ions) through it.
* **Silver** [Highest Conductivity] --> **Copper** --> **Gold** --> **Aluminum** --> **Tungsten** --> **Iron** --> **Nichrome**. 

## Insulators

* Material that prevent the flow of electrons or ions, stabilizing them-self by absorbing valance electors or electrons are too tightly bound that they can not freely move
* **Mica** [Highest] --> **Glass** --> **Teflon** --> **Paper** --> **Rubber** --> **Bakelite** --> **Oils** --> **Procelain** --> **Air**
* They are 5 or more electrons in the valance shell.

## SemiConductors

* Can be altered to function as either conductors or insulators.
* Element :- Germanium (Ge), Carbon (C), Silicon (Si), Semiconductor made from them are called intrinsic (Pure), conductivity depends on only temperature.
* There are also doped semiconductors, were impurities are added.


## Super Conductor

* The material which exhibits Zero electrical resistance and expels magnetic field at cooled below certain critical temperature.
* When they cool down electrons not collide and can flow the electricity with out decay.
* They are also expel magnetic fields from inside so either they repel it or make it float (Magnetic Levitation).
* Ex :- Ceramics
## Negative and Positive charge Ion

* **Negative Ion** :- A negative charged atoms, Taken electron
* **Positive Ion** :- A positive Charged Ions, Given Electron
* **Ionization** :- The process of gaining and loosing electrons,

## Current 

* Movement of electrons from negatively charged atom to positively charged atom.
* Represented as ***I***.

## Coulomb

* ***6.24 x 10^18***
* Represented as ***C***

## Ampere

* Define as the **One Coulomb moving  past a single point in one sec.**
* Current Measured in ***amperes***.
* Represented by ***A***

## Potential

* The ability of the source to perform electrical work.
* The Difference of potential causes electrons to move in a circuit called ***Electromotive Force (emf) or Voltage***

## Voltage

* The force that moves the electron in the circuit, or can say a pump or pressure.
* Represented by ***E***.
* Unit of measurement called the ***Volt***.

## Resistance

* Opposition to the flow of electron, it depends on ***Size, Shape, or Temp***.
* Measured in ***Ohms***.
* Represented by Greek letter **Omega** ***Î©***.
