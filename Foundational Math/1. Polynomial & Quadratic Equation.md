## 1. The Number System

### 1.1 Real Numbers (`ℝ`)
*   **Definition:** Any number that can be found on a number line. They form the most common set of numbers we use.
*   **Visualization:** Imagine an infinite line. Every point on that line corresponds to a Real Number.
    

*   **Subsets of Real Numbers:**
    1.  **Rational Numbers (`ℚ`):** Numbers that can be expressed as a ratio (fraction) of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   Integers: `...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...`
            *   Fractions: `1/2, -4/9, 7/1`
            *   Terminating Decimals: `0.5` (which is `1/2`)
            *   Repeating Decimals: `0.333...` (which is `1/3`), `0.1666...` (which is `1/6`)
    2.  **Irrational Numbers:** Numbers that **cannot** be expressed as a simple fraction. Their decimal expansions are non-terminating and non-repeating.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   `π` (Pi) ≈ 3.1415926535...
            *   `e` (Euler's Number) ≈ 2.7182818284...
            *   `√2` ≈ 1.4142135623... (The square root of any non-perfect square is irrational)

## 2. Polynomials

### 2.1 What is a Polynomial?
A polynomial is a special type of algebraic expression with specific rules.

$$
	P(x)=an​xn+an−1​xn−1+…+a1​x+a0
$$

**Formal Definition:** A function `P(x)` is a polynomial if:
1.  **The Domain** is all Real Numbers (`(-∞, +∞)`). You can plug any real number into `x`.
2.  **The Powers of `x`** (exponents) must be **whole numbers** (0, 1, 2, 3,...). They cannot be negative or fractions.
3.  **The coefficients** (numbers like `a`, `b`, `c`) are real numbers.
4. And it has finite terms, as we have to find the degree.

### 2.2 Degree of a Polynomial
*   **Definition:** The highest power of the variable `x` in the polynomial.
*   **Condition:** The coefficient of the highest power term must be **non-zero** (`a ≠ 0`).

### 2.3 Types of Polynomials (by Degree)

| Type | General Form | Degree | Example | Domain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Constant** | `P(x) = k` (e.g., `k=5`) | 0 (or undefined) | `P(x) = 7` | `(-∞, +∞)` |
| **Linear** | `P(x) = ax + b` | 1 | `P(x) = 3x + 2` | `(-∞, +∞)` |
| **Quadratic** | `P(x) = ax² + bx + c` | 2 | `P(x) = 2x² - 4x + 1` | `(-∞, +∞)` |
| **Cubic** | `P(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d` | 3 | `P(x) = x³ - 3x` | `(-∞, +∞)` |

### 2.4 Types of Polynomials (by Number of Terms)

| Type | Number of Terms | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monomial** | One term | `4x⁵` (degree 5), `-2x` (degree 1), `9` (constant) |
| **Binomial** | Exactly two terms | `3x + 2` (degree 1), `x² - 9` (degree 2) |
| **Trinomial** | Exactly three terms | `ax² + bx + c` (degree 2) |

### 2.5 What is NOT a Polynomial? (With Examples)
Let's check the examples from your notes:

1.  `f(x) = 4x² - 2x + 1` → **YES**. Powers of `x` are whole numbers (2, 1, 0).
2.  `f(x) = 1/(3x - 2)` → **NO**. This is a **Rational Function**. The variable `x` is in the denominator (equivalent to `(3x-2)⁻¹`), which is a negative exponent.
3.  `f(x) = x^(1/3) + 4` → **NO**. This is an **Irrational Function**. The power `1/3` is a fraction.
4.  `f(x) = (3x² - 2x + 1)/(4x + 5)` → **NO**. This is a **Rational Function** (a ratio of two polynomials).
5.  `f(x) = e^x` → **NO**. This is a **Transcendental Function**. The variable `x` is an exponent.
6.  `f(x) = log x` → **NO**. This is a **Transcendental Function** (a logarithmic function).
7.  `f(x) = |x|` → **NO**. This is a **Piecewise Function** (its definition changes at x=0: `|x| = x` if `x≥0` and `-x` if `x<0`).

**Important Notes:**
*   A polynomial must have a **finite** number of terms.
    *   `P(x) = 2x¹⁵⁰ + 5x¹⁴⁹ - 3x²² + √3x²³ - 2x⁶` is a polynomial (degree 150).
    *   `P(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + …` is **not** a polynomial if the series goes on forever (infinite terms).
*   **Polynomial vs. Polynomial Equation:**
    *   `P(x) = ax² + bx + c` is a **Quadratic Polynomial**.
    *   `ax² + bx + c = 0` is a **Quadratic Equation**.

## 3. Roots of Polynomial Equations

### 3.1 What is a Root? (Also called Solution/Zero/Zero Crossing)
*   For a polynomial `P(x)`, a number `α` (alpha) is called a **root** if `P(α) = 0`.
*   **Graphically:** A real root is the **x-coordinate** of the point where the graph of `y = P(x)` crosses or touches the x-axis. This is also called **zero crossing**.

**(Graphical representation of a cubic polynomial crossing the x-axis at three points, labeled α, β, and γ)**
*In this graph, `x = α, β, γ` are the roots because `f(α) = f(β) = f(γ) = 0`.*

**Example:**
`P(x) = x² - 5x + 6`
Check if `x=3` is a root: `P(3) = (3)² - 5*(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0`. ✅ Yes, it is.
Solving `P(x)=0` gives `(x-2)(x-3)=0`, so the roots are `x=2` and `x=3`.

### 3.2 Real vs. Complex Roots
*   **Real Roots:** Can be plotted on a number line. The graph crosses the x-axis at these points.
*   **Complex Roots:** Involve the imaginary unit `i` (where `i² = -1`). The graph does **not** cross the x-axis at these roots.

**Example of Complex Roots:**
`P(x) = x² + 4`
Set `P(x)=0`: `x² + 4 = 0` => `x² = -4` => `x = ±√(-4) = ±2i`
Check: `P(2i) = (2i)² + 4 = 4i² + 4 = 4(-1) + 4 = -4 + 4 = 0`. ✅
So, the roots are `x = 2i` and `x = -2i` (a complex conjugate pair).

### 3.3 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
This is a crucial theorem:
> **"A polynomial equation of degree `n` has exactly `n` roots (real or complex)."**

**Consequences:**
*   A linear polynomial (degree 1) has exactly 1 root.
*   A quadratic polynomial (degree 2) has exactly 2 roots.
*   A cubic polynomial (degree 3) has exactly 3 roots.

**Example:** `x² - 6x + 9 = 0` => `(x-3)² = 0`. The roots are `x=3` and `x=3`. We say it has **one distinct (real) root with a multiplicity of 2**. It still has 2 roots in total, as guaranteed by the theorem.

### 3.4 Complex Conjugate Root Theorem
> **"If a polynomial has real coefficients, then any complex roots must occur in conjugate pairs."** (If `a + bi` is a root, then `a - bi` must also be a root).

**Important Exception:** This is only true if the coefficients are real numbers.
*   Your example `x² - (3+5i)x + 15i = 0` has roots `x=3` and `x=5i`. They are **not** conjugates because the coefficients (1, -(3+5i), 15i) are **not all real numbers**.

**Key Insight:** If a polynomial has an **odd degree** (1, 3, 5, ...) and all coefficients are real, it **must have at least one real root**. Why? Because complex roots come in pairs (e.g., 2, 4, 6...), so you can't have an odd number of roots without at least one being real.
